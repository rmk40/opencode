# Security

## IMPORTANT

We do not accept AI generated security reports. We receive a large number of
these and we absolutely do not have the resources to review them all. If you
submit one that will be an automatic ban from the project.

## Threat Model

### Overview

OpenCode is an AI-powered coding assistant that runs locally on your machine. It provides an agent system with access to powerful tools including shell execution, file operations, and web access.

### No Sandbox

OpenCode does **not** sandbox the agent. The permission system exists as a UX feature to help users stay aware of what actions the agent is taking - it prompts for confirmation before executing commands, writing files, etc. However, it is not designed to provide security isolation.

If you need true isolation, run OpenCode inside a Docker container or VM.

### Server Mode

Server mode is opt-in only. Loopback binds (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1`) may run unauthenticated for local development. Set `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` to require HTTP Basic Auth.

Non-loopback binds, including `0.0.0.0` and mDNS defaults, refuse to start without `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD`. Users can override this by passing `--allow-insecure-no-auth` or setting `server.allowInsecureNoAuth`.

If a user opts into unauthenticated network access with `--allow-insecure-no-auth` or `server.allowInsecureNoAuth`, they are responsible for securing the server. Any functionality exposed by that server is expected behavior, not a vulnerability.

### Out of Scope

| Category                        | Rationale                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server access when opted-in** | If you enable server mode, API access is expected behavior              |
| **Sandbox escapes**             | The permission system is not a sandbox (see above)                      |
| **LLM provider data handling**  | Data sent to your configured LLM provider is governed by their policies |
| **MCP server behavior**         | External MCP servers you configure are outside our trust boundary       |
| **Malicious config files**      | Users control their own config; modifying it is not an attack vector    |
